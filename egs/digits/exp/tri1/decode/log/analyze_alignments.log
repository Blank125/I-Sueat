The optional-silence phone sil occupies 46.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 27.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 24.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,25.4,66)

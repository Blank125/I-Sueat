The optional-silence phone sil occupies 41.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 86.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 35.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.4 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 21.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (57,70.2,153)

# I-SUEAT: SPEECH-TO-TEXT OF THE AKEANON LANGUAGE
This project presents the development of the I-Sueat speech-to-text system that would be able to recognize Akeanon words with a decent accuracy rating. The system would be made using the open-source speech recognition toolkit “Kaldi”. Kaldi is a speech recognition toolkit written in C++ and licensed under the Apache License v2.0. The system would be developed in a way such that the audio, acoustic and language data would be catered to the Akeanon dialect.
